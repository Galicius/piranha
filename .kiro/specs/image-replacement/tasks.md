# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Create image analysis and processing utilities
  - Write functions to analyze user-provided images (format, dimensions, file size)
  - Implement image optimization pipeline for WebP conversion and resizing
  - Create filename generation utility following kebab-case convention
  - Add unit tests for image processing functions
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 3.3_

- [ ] 2. Build image mapping and tracking system
  - Create data structure to track old vs new image assignments
  - Implement mapping logic to categorize images by folder (signature, classics, seasonal, gallery)
  - Write functions to update mock.js image references programmatically
  - Add validation to ensure mapping consistency
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1-4.7_

- [ ] 3. Implement backup and safety mechanisms
  - Create backup system to preserve original images before replacement
  - Write rollback functionality to restore original images if needed
  - Implement selective rollback for individual image categories
  - Add logging system to track all replacement operations
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.4_

- [ ] 4. Create image verification and validation system
  - Write automated tests to verify image loading functionality
  - Implement size and format validation for optimized images
  - Create visual verification checklist generator
  - Add performance testing for image loading times
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.4, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 5. Build systematic replacement workflow
  - Create command-line interface or script for batch image processing
  - Implement category-by-category replacement logic (signature → classics → seasonal → gallery)
  - Add progress tracking and status reporting during replacement
  - Write error handling for failed image processing or replacement
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.5, 4.1-4.7_

- [ ] 6. Update mock.js and image references
  - Modify galleryImages array to use new local image paths
  - Update signatureCocktails localImagePath properties
  - Preserve existing fallback URLs as backup system
  - Ensure all image references maintain existing naming patterns
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.3, 2.5_

- [ ] 7. Create comprehensive testing suite
  - Write integration tests for OptimizedImage component with new images
  - Test responsive image loading across different device sizes
  - Verify fallback system still works with external URLs
  - Add automated tests for all image categories and references
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [ ] 8. Generate documentation and reporting
  - Create final replacement report showing old vs new image mappings
  - Document optimization settings used for each image category
  - Generate verification checklist for manual review
  - Write troubleshooting guide for common image replacement issues
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.5_
