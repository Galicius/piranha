# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves systematically replacing existing images on the Piranha Cocktail Bureau website with new user-provided images. The site currently has a hybrid image system that uses both local images (stored in frontend/public/images/) and external fallback URLs. The goal is to replace all placeholder and existing images with high-quality, brand-consistent photography that matches the site's noir cocktail bar aesthetic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want to replace all existing images with my own professional photography, so that my site reflects my actual cocktails and bar atmosphere instead of stock photos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new images are provided THEN the system SHALL identify all current image locations and their naming conventions
2. WHEN replacing images THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing folder structure (signature/, classics/, seasonal/, gallery/, etc.)
3. WHEN processing new images THEN the system SHALL optimize them for web use (WebP format, appropriate sizing, compression)
4. WHEN images are replaced THEN the system SHALL preserve the existing image naming patterns to maintain code compatibility
5. IF an image cannot be optimized THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about the issue and suggested resolution

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see consistent, high-quality images that load quickly, so that I have a professional browsing experience that matches the bar's brand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are replaced THEN all images SHALL be optimized for web performance (under 500KB each)
2. WHEN images are displayed THEN they SHALL maintain consistent visual style (dark, moody, professional cocktail photography)
3. WHEN images load THEN they SHALL use the existing responsive image system without breaking layouts
4. WHEN viewing on different devices THEN images SHALL display properly across mobile, tablet, and desktop
5. IF an image fails to load THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to the existing external URL system

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the site, I want the image replacement process to be systematic and documented, so that I can easily manage and update images in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN replacing images THEN the system SHALL create a mapping document showing old vs new image assignments
2. WHEN images are processed THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate file names following kebab-case convention
3. WHEN images are optimized THEN the system SHALL document the optimization settings used
4. WHEN replacement is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a verification checklist to ensure all images display correctly
5. IF any images are missing or broken THEN the system SHALL generate a report of issues that need attention

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want to organize my images by category and purpose, so that the site structure remains maintainable and images are easy to find and update.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN categorizing images THEN signature cocktail images SHALL be placed in /cocktails/signature/ folder
2. WHEN categorizing images THEN classic cocktail variations SHALL be placed in /cocktails/classics/ folder  
3. WHEN categorizing images THEN seasonal specials SHALL be placed in /cocktails/seasonal/ folder
4. WHEN categorizing images THEN bar atmosphere photos SHALL be placed in /gallery/bar/ folder
5. WHEN categorizing images THEN ingredient close-ups SHALL be placed in /gallery/ingredients/ folder
6. WHEN categorizing images THEN process shots SHALL be placed in /gallery/process/ folder
7. IF an image doesn't fit existing categories THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate folder placement or new category creation
